Steve Walton - Github Tech Support Application

Hey guys,

Thanks for checking out my application for the remote support role at Github.

One of the things I love best about doing this type of work is getting our user's issues ‘unstuck’. Sometimes users just need a reliable guy who really understands their needs and that's what I want to contribute to the Github community.

As an experienced remote web project manager, ecommerce entrepreneur and account manager, I will hit the ground running for you and leverage my experience and skills to ensure Github's ongoing success through awesome support for our users.

If you guys have any questions please feel free to reach out over phone, email or by adding to this repoitory. Also, please check out my Linkedin & Twitter for further insight into my professional career.

Thanks guys and have a great day,

Steve Walton
